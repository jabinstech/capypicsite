# CapyPic
The ultimate capybara picture Discord bot.
## Just the basics.
CapyPic currently includes 3 commands.
`-capybara` - you know what that does.
`-ping` - returns bot's response time
`-about` - about bot.
## How it works
CapyPic is a fork of the currently in-development Jot3 bot, with just the basics you want for capybaras!
It uses the API from [capy.lol](https://capy.lol/) to get all of its capybara pictures.
CapyPic is written in Java using the [Discord4J](https://discord4j.com/) library.
